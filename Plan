This is the plan, 
I am developing a machine learning model where the predictor variables are derived from sentiment analysis data, and the target variable is the stock price. 
The sentiment analysis data, encompassing aspects like social media sentiment, analyst ratings, or news headlines, will be used to train the model to predict future movements in stock prices. 
This approach treats stock prices as the dependent variable, influenced by the independent variables captured through various sentiment indicators.


Definition of "Magnificent 7 Stocks": Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Nvdia, Google (M7)
News Sentiment Analysis: I need to get data from analysts, social media and news headline anything that mentions M7, and somehow distill it into a quantitative value
Correlation with Price Action: After interpeting the data, need to figure out if it affeccts the price (go up or down)
Data Collection and Analysis Methods: Try to scrape internet, the use some form of language interpretation to get sentiment
Interpretation of Results: Using either genetic programming or deep learning try to find a possible combination of coefficients that will allow the model to predict the price action of these stocks
